<p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 14px;">Arguments for the existence of God come in many different forms; some draw on history, some on science, some on personal experience, and some on philosophy.
 Others give philosophical arguments—based on morality, ancient traditions and sustenance of this planet.Each of these arguments, are successful, support a 
 certain conception of God: the ontological argument, for instance, is an argument for the existence of a perfect being; the first cause argument is an 
 argument for the existence of an eternal Creator; the argumentfrom design is an argument for the existence of Creator with a special interest in humanity; 
 the moral argument is an argument for a moral authority.The post here discusses each and every element of argument touch basing modern to advance ancient 
 texts. And successfully proves that Krishna is indeed Supreme Bhagwan of all Universes and planets including our earth.</p>

<h3>1.Krishna Existed For Billions of Years</h3>
<i>All are Hindu by birth but became atheist later due to influence of Kali, these atheists cannot take breath without natural air provided by Bhagwan Krishna himself but still question existence of Supreme God.</i>

<h4>Brief on Existence of Bhagwan Krishna</h4>
<b>Lets begin explanation on existence of Bhagwan Krishna later we cover scientific, spriritual and archeological proof too.</b>

<p class="text-justify"> As per Vedic texts, there can be always two types of humans one who believe in Lord and other who believe in God but according to their suitability and comfort. So if their wishes are fulfilled then God exists and when they are unable to find any reason to solve their problem, they blame it on God. Even these so called non-believers do believe in God because when they say they don’t believe in God they lack reason why they don’t believe and even reference to the God of non-believing him is actually advocating his existence in nirakar roop. Krishna exists in all forms including basic saakar and nirakar roop.
<br/>Its the karma that makes one feel that God doesn’t exist, its not you that find Krishna, its Krishna that selects you to surrender unto him.
<br/>Devtas follow teachings of Krishna while Asuras follow their own instincts which is again controlled by Shri Krishna. So No one can escape Krishna’s spiritual consciousness. He exists in every thing in this world and universe.
<br/><b> Bhagwad Gita 9.11 -12 : “When I appear in My human-like form ( Sri Krishna) , foolish people with mundane intelligence disrespect Me, because they cannot recognize Me as the Supreme God . All their hopes are in vain. These deluded Fools will be re-born again and again as Atheists and Asuras.”</b>
<br/>Good sense prevails and the main objective is to strengthen believers not to become more self-disciplined rather than expecting Asura centric beings to convert to Hinduism.
</p>
<h4>What Atheists Fail to Respond On ?</h4>
<p>Atheists never were able to answer these queries but answers are available in Srimad Bhagwat Puran and  Bhagwat Gita
<br/>1) How world is created
<br/>2) Why ozone layer is covering the world
<br/>3) What is above earth and below earth
<br/>4) What is lying in earth’s crust
<br/>5) How earth is balanced and distance is maintained arithmetically between Sun and Moon
<br/>6) What is the reason of eclipses
<br/>7) How is flow of energy so constantly maintained in this universe
<br/>8) What is inter-dimensional travel ? How it can be achieved
<br/>9) Where is soul situated in body ? How to make it more powerful
<br/>10) How body attains mass
<br/><br/>
The answers to these queries is so long and detailing that this post would take more than year to finish. But mere referring the above texts with open eyes and mind can make you aware of existence of Bhagwan Krishna and how the supreme God of multi-universe and parallel worlds manages this great galactic arrangement.
</p>
<h4>Did Krishna exist?</h4>
<p>

</p>

<h3>2.Why Krishna is Lord?</h3>
<p>Do you know Lord’s name, qualities, address, description, history dating back to billions of years, witnessed by millions, and proven?If you can answer these questions, only then can you truly say you know God. Otherwise you are simply living in darkness.The Vedic scriptures are the oldest scriptures in the World and the only scriptures that can answer all these questions and in detail.The Vedic scriptures completely describe God. His history, address, qualities, description, how he creates and maintains and so on. That God is Bhagwan Krishna.1. The first requirement is that the contender for the position of the supreme has been seen.
</p>
<h4>Seeing is Believing and Beliefs Noted Down in Texts</h4>
<p>
<b>1. Seeing is believing, not seeing is pure speculation</b>
Bhagwan Krishna has incarnated at least 9 times so far in the current cycle of creation. In each incarnation millions saw him. There is scientific evidence to prove that he existed 5000 years ago, as stated in the Vedic scriptures. Scientists have found the city where Bhagwan Krishna lived in Dwarka, India, as described in the Vedic scriptures.
<strong> NASA has taken satellite pictures of the bridge between India and Sri Lanka that Bhagwan Krishna built in his Lord Ram incarnation, some 1.7 million years ago.</strong>
Carbon dating proves it correct also stones there still float on water when thrown into river.
</p>
<h4>How Krishna Looks</h4>
<p>
<b>2. The second requirement is that the contender’s description is known.</b>
<b>How can you believe in someone without actually seeing them or knowing what they look like?</b>
Bhagwan Krishna has a form just like a human being. Even the Christian Bible states that man is made in the image of God. According to them, this means that God has a human form with two hands, 2 legs and so on. Krishna descended on earth in 9 avatars taking human form. Though Jesus claimed to son of God. Some christians do believe that this God referred by Jesus was non other than Bhagwan Krishna
<br/><b>1.</b>His complexion is dark-blue, like that of a rain filled cloud.
<br/><b>2.</b>His eyes are like lotus petals.
<br/><b>3.</b>He is ever youthful.
<br/><b>4.</b>He is full of bliss and his beauty excels that of thousand of most beautiful beings of this universe.
<br/><b>5.</b>He likes to play the flute.
<br/><b>6.</b>He wears a peacock feather in his crown.
<br/><b>7.</b>He wears the Kaustubha jewel around his neck.
<br/><b>8.</b>He wears yellow garments.
<br/><br/>Bhagwan Krishna is complete in six kinds of opulence – wisdom, beauty, fame, power, wealth, and renunciation.

</div>
<div class="col-sm-9" style="margin-top:40px;">
<p> <b>3. The third requirement is that the contender’s divinity is proven.</b>
<br/>Anyone can claim to be Lord, but who can actually prove it?
<br/>To protect innocent people from imposters, Arjuna asked Bhagwan Krishna to prove his divinity. Bhagwan Krishna granted Arjuna divine vision and revealed his spectacular unlimited forms as the cosmic universe. Thus he conclusively established his divinity.
<br/><br/>“Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths, unlimited eyes, unlimited wonderful visions. The form was decorated with many celestial ornaments and bore many diving upraised weapons. He wore celestial garlands and garments, and many divine scents were smeared over his body. All was wondrous, brilliant, unlimited, all expanding. If hundreds of thousands of suns were to rise at once into the sky, their radiance might resemble the effulgence of the supreme person in that universal form.”
<br/><br/>In each incarnation, Bhagwan Krishna proved that he was Lord, all the details can be found in the Srimad Bhagavatam. Here we will focus on his incarnation 5000 years ago.

<br/>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-9"><p><b>Bhagwan Krishna performed miracles that no other being can perform.</b><br/>
<b>1.</b>When Bhagwan Krishna was 7 years old, he lifted a mountain (26 miles in perimeter) and held it up on his pinky finger for consecutive 7 days. Witnessed by tens of thousands of people who were standing underneath the mountain.
<br/><b>2.</b>Bhagwan Krishna expanded his body into 16,108 forms. Which means he duplicated his body into 16,108 identical bodies.
<br/><b>3.</b>Bhagwan Krishna transformed himself into others. This means he can make himself like anyone.
<br/><b>4.</b>Bhagwan Krishna showed in his mouth, the whole Universe.
<br/><b>5.</b>Bhagwan Krishna granted Arjuna divine vision and reveled his spectacular unlimited form as the cosmic universe. In which Arjuna could see the various forms of Bhagwan Krishna, and unlimited Planets while being seated in one place. He was also shown the past, present, and future.
<br/><b>6.</b>Bhagwan Krishna killed all the wicked Kings who were tormenting and harassing the public. People were saved in this very life and didn’t have to wait for the Day of Judgment.
<br/><b>7.</b>When a royal woman, Draupadi, was disrobed in a court of kings, she called out to Bhagwan Krishna for help and he divinely draped her with an unlimited sari and thus she could not be disrobed.
<br/><b>8.</b>Many atheists tried to kill Bhagwan Krishna, but Bhagwan Krishna very easily defeated them all and also blessed them with moksha, liberation. Bhagwan Krishna is most merciful; he gives liberation even to those who try to kill him. Bhagwan give liberation; one does not need to wait for the Day of Judgment. Asuri atheist Putna pretending to breast feed tried to kill him but Bhagwan Krishna gave her gati (divine liberation) like deserving Yashoda mother.
<br/><b>9.</b>Bhagwan Krishna brought back to life many dead people including the six children of Devaki.
<br/><b>10.</b> Bhagwan Krishna cured diseased people including transforming a hunchback woman into a most beautiful woman in return for offering sandalwood pulp to the Bhagwan.

<div class="col-sm-3" style="margin-top:30px;"><center><h4>Proof of Super Powers of Our Lord</h4></center>

<p>“It should be understood that all species of life, o son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed giving father” (Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 14.4)
“I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support and the grandesire”(Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 9.17)</p>

<h4>Supreme Creator: Bhagwan Krishna is the origin of all.</h4>
<p>“The whole cosmic order is under me. By my will it is manifested again and again, and by my will it is annihilated at the end” (Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 9.8)
<br/>“Furthermore, O Arjuna, I am the generating seed of all existences. There is no being, moving or unmoving, that can exist without me” (Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 10.39)
<br/>“I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts”(Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 10.8)
<br/>“Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both the origin and the dissolution” (Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 7.6)
</p>
<h4>  Supreme Controller: Bhagwan Krishna is the supreme controller.</h4>
<p> “I give heat, and I withhold and send forth the rain” (Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 9.19)
<br/>“With a single fragment of myself I pervade and support this entire universe”(Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 10.42)
</p>
<h4>Supreme Maintainer:</h4>
<p>“The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of the whole world, comes from me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from me” (Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 15.12)
<br/>“I enter into each planet, and by energy they stay in orbit” (Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 15.13)
<br/>“This material nature, which is one of my energies is working under my direction”(Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 9.10)</p>

<h4>Omnipresent: Bhagwan Krishna is omnipresent, meaning he is present everywhere.</h4>
<p>“I am the supersoul, O Arjuna, seated in the hearts of all living entities, I am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all beings” (Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 10.20)</p>
<h4> Omnipotent: Bhagwan Krishna is omnipotent, meaning he is the greatest.</h4>
<p>“There is no truth beyond Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread”(Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 7.7)</p>
<h4>Omniscient: Bhagwan Krishna knows the past, present, and the future.</h4>
<p>“O Arjuna, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities” (Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 7.26)
<br/>“Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot!”(Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 4.5)</p>
<h4>There is Only One God:</h4>
<p>“Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only me, O son of Kunti, but they do so in a wrong way. I am the only enjoyer and master of all (yagna) sacrifices. Therefore, those who do not recognize my true transcendental nature fall down”(Bhagwan Krishna, Bhagavad-Gita 9.24)</p>
<h4>God – Ancient than Antiquity</h4>
<p><b>5. The fifth requirement is that the contender’s history dating back to Billions of years is known.</b>
<br/>Full details on the pastimes of Bhagwan Krishna in each of his incarnations can be found in the Srimad Bhagavatam.
<br/>The Vedic scriptures contain the history of Bhagwan Krishna dating back to billions of years.</p>
<h4> Authorized Scriptures, Most Ancient Ever Known to Humans</h4>
<p><b>6. The sixth requirement is that the contender’s supremacy is mentioned in authorized scriptures.</b>
<br/>The Vedic scriptures are the only scriptures that have existed since the beginning of time, and thus eternal and the absolute truth. There is no higher authority than that of the Vedic scriptures. Vedic scriptures talk about billions of celestial planets and that universe is trillions of years old and Hindu texts are being in existence since billions of years, and still these texts are valid even today.The gyan shared by Bhagwan Krishna with all is time proven and factually accurate.
<br/><br/>Even today scientists, cosmologists, physicists, medical practitioners refer Vedic texts whenever they are struck in their research and experiments. Albert Einstein, Nicolas Tesla, Robert Oppenheimer and many other atheist confirmed in their papers that they referred Vedic texts and Bhagwad Gita for more insightful theories. No other religious text is ever been cited so many times in papers filed by eminent scientists of the world- who became eminent only rediscovering which is already known to mankind through these great Vedic texts. Thanks to Hinduism to keep these alive for the mankind.
