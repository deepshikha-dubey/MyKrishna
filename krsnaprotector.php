<p class="text-justify">Once Krishna was having prasadam and Rukmini Mata was serving Him. One devotee of Krishna was walking in the forest.
Suddenly a wild dog came and started attacking the devotee. At that point,Krishna in Dwaraka immediately got up and He was ready to leave to help that devotee.
Then suddenly He sat down again and started calmly taking the prasadam. So Rukmini mata was confused and asked the reason for this behavior.
Krishna explained the whole thing about the devotee being attacked by the dog and Rukmini Mata said why He did not go to protect him?
Krishna explained that He was ready to protect the devotee but the devotee instead of having faith in the Lord, he immediately picked up a big stone to throw at the dog.
So Krishna said that He could not tell the difference between the devotee and the dog. They were the same. They both are aggressive with intention to hurt each other.
<br/><br/><b>Moral of the story;</b><br/>
We become agitated and angry when we do not surrender to Krishna. Then we have no faith that whatever has happened is Krishna’s will and that we should seek his shelter and help.
If we accept it, we do not become agitated, anxious and angry. When you are anxious and agitated, you become angry.
When you are angry, your symptoms will be in anxiety and agitated. All the three ‘A’s are on the foundation of one ‘E’ and that is envy.
Envy is coming from pride. Pride is followed by envy and it is manifested full blown in anger.
Prthu Maharaj was a great personality, but a little bit of Indra’s presence in his life changed the course of his life.
How did such a great personality become angry, agitated and anxious? Because Prthu Maharaj took the association of Indra. Asat-sanga.
How did he take the association? He was not holding hands with Indra but he was meditating on Indra.
Prthu Maharaj’s mind kept on thinking of Indra and the more you remember that which causes you agitation and anxiety, unknown to you, like poison, that anxiety, that envy, also gets transferred to us.</p>

<div class="col-md-9" style="margin-top:40px;">
<p class="text-justify">Followed by Suresvaracharya and otherdisciples, Sankara moved southwards. In course of time, the party reached Srisailam hills in Andhra Pradesh. In those days, there lived a sect of religious  fanatics called the Kapalikas, who believed in human sacrifice. One day Sri Sankara was sitting deeply 
 immersed in meditation. At that time, a Kapalika came before him. He woke up Sankara from his meditation
 and told him that God Kapali would appear to him if he sacrificed either the head of an emperor or the head 
 of a great Sannyasin. Sankara was amused. He smiled and said that he had no objection whatsoever to surrender 
 his head. He would come to the temple of Bhairava at midnight without the knowledge of his disciples. 
 Overjoyed that his wishes would be fulfilled, the Kapalika got busy with the preliminary rites of worship 
 before the human sacrifice. Man proposes, but God disposes. Sankara got up from his bed at midnight and left
 for the temple of Bhairava. Padmapada sensed some danger to his Guru. He earnestly prayed to Lord Narasimha 
 to protect his Guru. Padmapada ran to the spot and with the mighty strength of a lion snatched the sword from
 the hands of the Kapalika. He then jumped on the Kapalika and tore him to pieces. Sankara saw Lord Narasimha
 before him and was overjoyed. He at once composed a thrilling hymn on Lord Narasimha.</p></div>

<div class="col-md-9">
<P class="text-justify"><br><br><br><br>The story where Lord Narasimha courageously protected his child devotee Bhakta Prahlad
 and killed his demoniac father Hiranyakashipu. Since today is the apperance day of Lord Narasimha, I 
 thought it would be appropriate to share my experience with Lord Narasimha and how he protected me. It 
 was all during the summer of 2013 when my aunt and uncle wanted to take me and my brother on a vacation 
 to congratulate us for our success in middle school. At the time I was still getting into the whole 
 beliefs of Krishna Conciousness and was still a rookie devotee. I was especially attracted to one of Lord
 Krishna's famous avatars, Narasimha. At night time I would often have troubling nightmares, because I 
 had experienced some traumatic events in my younger life as a kid which led me to depression and anxiety
 . Across from my bed was my nightstand and on it was a picture of Narasimha for protection, and 
 everytime I woke up from my nightmares I would feel relief by looking at Lord Narasimha, and I just
 knew he was protecting me because I could feel his protection. Anyway, onto the story of the vacation.
 We went to rocky mountain national park in Colorado, a very beautiful place filled with mountains.
 Before we left I was a bit nervous because we had to get their by plane, and I had a phobia of hights, 
 so just to feel safe I recited the Narasimha Kavacham before leaving. <font color="blue">Read more...</font>
  <p id="p1"> After the flight we traveled by car up the mountains. The part where things got unsettling was when I realized the trail that led up the
 mountain was completely unguarded and had no fences to keep us from falling off. So naturally, I felt 
 a huge wave of anxiety flood over me. I griped tightly on my icon of Narasimha and chanted his name so
 we wouldn't fall off the cliff, luckily I felt great relief when we didn't fall off the cliff. 
So a few hours past and we finally got into our cabin. That following night I stayed up later than everyone else 
 to continue chanting my japa, when I heard a sound outside of my cabin. I considered it to be nothing, 
 since we were around forests and what not I thought it was just a deer. So I continued chanting, when 
 the same noise occured again. This noise was not something like a branch snapping or something cheesy
 like that, but rather it was the sound of hard knocking. I had woke up my brother due to the noise and 
 I asked if we should tell our aunt and uncle what was going on. But my brother told me not to, as we might anger them if it turns out to be nothing. So instead we went back to sleep only to be awoken 
 again by the same kind of noise a few hours later, only this time more louder than before. This time 
 we were seriously freaked out. I made a foolish decision and decided to look out the blind but did not
 see anything, only a very hard depiction of a shadowy figure standing by the other side of our cabin, 
 so I quickly shut the blind not doing anything else. We finally woke up our aunt and uncle and told 
 them what was happening and how I saw the shadowy figure outside, they looked around the house outside
 but found no trace of anything being around our cabin. So I considered it to be because of my anxiety,
 so I went back to sleep once more. The thing that happened next was the most terrifying experience I 
 ever had in my life. I woke up completely paralyzed and was not able to move. I could however still 
 breath and move my eyes around, and beside me there was the same shadowy figure I saw before, only this
 time standing right next to my bed. And I swear it started moving closer and closer to my bed and saw 
 the sheets also moved. At first I considered it to be just a regular case of sleep paralysis as I heard 
 this is what usually goes on, but I changed my mind and considered it to be a real demon as it moved my 
 sheets back. Logically, No scientist can say that the sheets moving had a logical explanation and tell 
 me it was just a product of my imagination, because if that were true then the sheets would not be 
 moving away from me when I had absolutely no ability to move. The demon just went above me and stared 
 at me for a good minute, I remembered I kept a small statue of Narasimha next to me and I loudly 
 chanted in my head "Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!" Until I finally bursted out "Narasimha help me!" 
 Outside in the far distance I could hear the sound of a lion and the demon instantly fled. My brother
 woke up from it and I informed him what had just happened. The next morning I told my aunt and uncle 
 about the experience. My belief in God strengthened from that point as I knew for a fact Lord Narasimha 
 had protected me. I know this story sounds extremely cheesy and artifical, but I tell you, this story 
 is none other than the truth. Lord Narasimha is the supreme protector of all his devotees, and will 
 stop at nothing to protect us. Sri Narasimha Ki! Jai!</p>

<img src="krishnakatha/krishnakatha (20).jpg" id="img" class="img-thumbnail">

<div class="col-md-9"><br><br><br><br><br>During vastraharan, Draupadi called out to her husbands as wells as the elders present there for help, but none came forward. When dushasana started pulling one end of her saree, she started praying to Lord Krishna for help. Being her friend, guide and confidante, Lord Krishna provided an unlimited supply of cloth to her saree so that Dushasana kept on pulling the saree from one end but the cloth in her saree never ended. This is how Lord Krishna helped Draupadi during vastraharan.

Apart from being her friend, one more reason which led Lord Krishna to help Draupadi by providing her cloth is that once Lord Krishna had needed some cloth to cover his body and Draupadi had torn a part of her saree to cover his body. So, in a way, Lord Krishna provided cloth for her saree in order to repay that debt. </div>
