<font class="textjustify"> This stanza starts with the Bhagavad Gita
Geeta is the basis for understanding the human psychology.
our culture's two poles, One is ShriRam and the other Dhruv is Sri Krishna
Ram is exemplary, Krishna is Thoughtful
सब कुछ होते हुए भी, उस सब में से कुछ न होकर निकल जाने की कला का नाम राम है
Aur न कुछ को सब कुछ में बदलकर उसके पार ठहर जाने की शैली का नाम कृष्णा है
Indian thinks say, Wherever there is life on Earth, it is the incarnation of Vishnu.
Whether the clouds roam, or whether the birds sing
All is expression of ShriVishnu element
</font>
<h4>The confluence of Sat-Chit..</h4>
<font class="text-justify"> The knowledge of this ultimate element was given by Shrikrishna to dejected Arjun in the field of Kurushet 5,000 years ago. Gita shrikrishna is a heart-breaking granth. Krishna is a strong man and even a poor man is probably the whole whole. Because everything is full of shrikrishna The only symbol of totality, therefore, any creature can see his reflection in him. In this entire universe, which is the sublimation capacitance and the constant sound which is heard, it is the descendant of Krishna.
<br/>Sat is everywhere, it is like the silent silence and happiness is unaffected, just like the butter remains hidden in the milk, in the same way, in the shelter of Shrikrushna, man becomes blissful. And Krishna also has such a compassionate heart that, if he calls through, then he acts in an instant. There is also Shri Krishna Raseshwar and Yogeshwar too. Even if you like music, you are still in the hands of Krishna. Where your attachment is your caste, you are in the hands of Krishna, and if you want to live unharmed, harmless and an unknown life, you should also support Krishna. Carey people should stay away from Krishna
<br/>Thinking about Krishna, think of such a child who is at risk of being killed before birth. Dense dark night, within a prison, a child is born in Zakir, and which is separated after birth, after 6 days of birth, Pootna tries to kill him, look neutral, then see the world as if it were the desire of lust Silk thread is a woven wire that is cursed to remain unresolved. Every kind of ambitious and kind man runs like a man. So much that lust becomes torture.
