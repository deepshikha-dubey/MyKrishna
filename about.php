  <p class="text-justify"> One of the most popular gods, the eighth and most important avatar or incarnation of Vishnu.
  Delivered the Bhagwad Geeta on the battlefield to Arjun when he was reluctant to kill his own kin. Krishna
  represents love, wisdom, intellect and the 700 verses of the Bhagwad Geeta contain a vast sea of knowledge.It gives us the message 
  to keep doing our duty without worrying about the result. <br>
  Why Krishna holds a flute? Why does he wear a peacock feather on his crown? Why does he wear Yellow clothes?
  Why does he always smile? Why do the ladies and even the cattle are drawn towards him?.... 
  The reason is HE IS REAL!!!... An extremely ecentric fellow, he always does what his heart says. Gentle,
  calm, contended... He is such a charmer! He doesnt give a button what people would think.  He loces music, 
  and the flute is the most soothing musical instrument compared to drums, guitars, harmoniams,  sitars, veena
  etc which sound jarring after sometime. He was an extremely charismatic person who loved silence and fun. We 
  see him as an extrovert, but actually he was the biggest introvert. He loved solace as much as he loved mischief... 
  Imagine a person who is sharp, creative, strong, shrewd and spiritual all in one.  That was Krishna...</p>

			  <h3>Krishna Flute</h3>

			</div><!-- End of image -->
			
			 <div class="col-md-9">
			   <p class="text-justify">Krishna is a cosmic musician, and the tune he creates by playing his transcendental flute is embodied with cosmic energy.
 As Krishna’s divine flute calls at any time of the day or night, nature, which is mesmerized by the captivating celestial tune, responds: 
 Lakes and rivers overflow with water, expanding their banks because they are desirous of embracing Krishna’s lotus feet. Drinking the opulent water,
 Mother Nature is perennially pregnant with luscious green, and trees and vines are unseasonably laden with fruits and flowers. One must understand Krishna 
 to understand the power and magic of his flute’s tune. Though it is presented on this Earth, it was created for Krishna’s abode, so there are strings 
 attached to the pastime. The frequently offered explanation is that all living creatures stilled by the captivating tune of Krishna’s flute are his
 companions of past times, scholars and sages who are interested in the Vedic knowledge that flows through the tune of his flute.
 To perceive that knowledge, one must be so absorbed in the music that he must, essentially, lose his self.  </p>

			<div class="col-md-9">
			 <p class="text-justify"> Sri Krishna ,in yellow robe around his shoulders and yellow dhoti in all the pictures and literary descriptions .
Yellow colour is considered asauspicious, it is traditionally regarded as the colour of religion. >Thus he represents Dharma by the colour of his dress.
Yellow colour also represents Earth. thus he also reflects his creation by this colour . >it seems as if the Creation is (i.e.-exists) in him as well as He is present in the Creation for ever .
Many times yellow has been associated with knowledge , learning , happiness , peace , meditaion , competence , mental development (spiritual awareness ). >All these can be very easily related to the LORD , both in reference to Vishu and Krishna, as they are one and the same .
Yellow is also the colour of Spring, we can grasp the meaning as soon as the picture of the LORD comes to our mind.
He himself is the embodiment of Spring , from him everything (beauty , fertility and happiness ) springs … >so yellow is the most suitable colour of the lord .
Yellow has another significance that is ‘helps to activate the mind’.

			<div class="col-md-9">
			  <p class="text-justify"> Cows and Krishna have always been together. In His original form in the spiritual world, Krishna is a
 cowherd boy in the agricultural community of Goloka ("cow planet") Vrindavan, where He keeps unlimited, transcendental surabhi cows. When He descends to
 earth, Krishna brings a replica of Vrindavan with Him, and He spends His childhood tending cows and calves while playing in the pasturing grounds with His
 friends. His example shows the importance of cows to human society, the practical benefits of caring for them, and the advantages of an agrarian economy 
 based on cooperation between man and cows.</p>

			  <h3>Krishna wear peacock Feather</h3>

			<div class="col-md-9">
			 <p class="text-justify">
 Lord Krishna always wear a peacock feather on his head! The first reason is the belief that, 
the peacock is the only creature in nature that observes complete chastity in life. When he is happy, he dances with his wings and his eyes are filled 
with tears, Peahen drink these tears & conceives. Peacock does not have, even a tinge of lust in his heart. The peacock feather contains all the seven 
colors in it. The entire universe is covered by akasha(ether) which appears blue in day times and black in night. So lord Krishna is identified by both 
the colors 'Blue' (neela) & 'Black' (shyaama). Krishna paksha in Indian calender means the days that follow after Full-moon day till the New-moon day i.e, 
the darker phase of 14 days of the moon. Further, he wears the peacock feather which signifies that the entire range of colors (we mortal beings) is in him. 
In virtue he is colorless but in the day he appears blue, black in the night to our vision and in between make us discuss all this mulch-coloured 
multi-perceptional views. The peacock feather signifies the exuberance of nature. Sri Krishna wears a peacock feather that reminds us of his play with
 the gopas and gopis of Sri Vrindavana. The male peacock especially has long been a symbol of romantic love, and the rasalila episode of Sri Krishna's 
 life teaches us how this kind of love may be directed to God.</p>
